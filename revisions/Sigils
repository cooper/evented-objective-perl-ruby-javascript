EOPRJ Sigil Revision

This file describes the changes made to EOPRJ sigil syntax on December 3, 2012.

Actual variable-fetching sigils

$ - gets a property from the current scope's object.
@ - gets a property from $SPECIAL object. Example: @return is $SPECIAL.return, the 'return' property of the scope object's 'SPECIAL' property.

Accessing the scope's object.

@scope accesses the actual object of the scope. 
As a result, since @ variables are from $SPECIAL, $SPECIAL.scope.SPECIAL.scope.SPECIAL……. never ends.

Sigils used for referencing, etc.

These are placed in front of one of the above sigils to access variables differently than the default behavior.

* - accesses the property of this very object, ignoring all ISA inheritance.
^ - accesses the actual physical location of an object. assigning to ^$var will change the value of any other variables that contain this same object because changing the value of the physical location literally overwrites the variable rather than reassigning it.
